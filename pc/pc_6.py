image:
shiny black pants with zipper open.
colorful shiny underthing with super 70s pattern.
an arrow pointing toward belt loop.

page title:
"now there are pairs"

hint:
comment "<-- zip" at opening html tag

note:
paypal button: html comment says not relevant to riddle.  
pants button says "sprint" twice

approach:
looking into zipfile

questions:

arrrrrrgh. gave up, and looked for hint. got the answer in the search result,
not just a hint. sigh. well, still need to implement it.

hint "<-- zip" at opening tag was pointing to the tag (html).
replace "html with "zip" and open 
http://www.pythonchallenge.com/pc/def/channel.zip

unzip, find many numbered txt files and a readme.
readme says:
"welcome to my zipped list.
hint1: start from 90052
hint2: answer is inside the zip"

90052.txt says:
"Next nothing is 94191"
