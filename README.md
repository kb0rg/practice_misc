## What's going on in this repo?

This is where I put coding challenges as I work on them, and sometimes revisit them. It's all about continuing my education/ dusting off the cobwebs on the CS fundamentals... and keeping stuff in one handy place for my own reference (and cross-reference, as I approach similar problems from different angles/ on different platforms)

Directories correspond to the sources of the challenges, including:
* [cw: codewars](http://www.codewars.com/)  
* [hr: hackerrank](https://www.hackerrank.com/)  
* [leet: leetcode](https://www.leetcode.com)  
* [pc: pythonchallenge](http://www.pythonchallenge.com/)  
* [psads: interactive python's problem solving with algorithms and data structures](http://interactivepython.org/runestone/static/pythonds/index.html)
* [ex: exercism](http://exercism.io/)
