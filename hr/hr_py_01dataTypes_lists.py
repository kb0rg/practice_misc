hackerrank: python: data types: lists 


Problem Statement:
When we talk about storing multiple values in a container-like data-structure, 
the first thing that comes to mind is a list.

You can initialize a list as:
>>> arr = list()
or simply
>>> arr = []
or with a few elements as
>>> arr = [1,2,3]

Elements can be accessed easily like you do in most programming languages.

>>> print arr[0]
1
>>> print arr[0] + arr[1] + arr[2]
6
Lists in python are very versatile. If you ask what you can add in a Python 
List, the answer is practically anything!

In python you can create a list of any object, be it string, integers, or even 
lists. You can even add multiple types in a single list! Isn't that exciting?

Let's look at some of the methods you can use on List.

1.) append(x) 
Adds a single element 'x' to the end of list.
>>> arr.append(9)   
>>> print arr  
[1, 2, 3, 9]

2.) extend(L) 
Merges another list 'L' to the end.
>>> arr.extend([10,11])
>>> print arr
[1, 2, 3, 9, 10, 11]

3.) insert (i,x) 
Inserts element 'x' at position 'i'.
>>> arr.insert(3,7)
>>> print arr
[1, 2, 3, 7, 9, 10, 11]

4.) remove(x) 
Removes the first occurrence of element x.
>>> arr.remove(10)  
>>> arr  
[1, 2, 3, 7, 9, 11]

5.) pop() 
Removes the last element of list. If an argument is passed, that index item is 
popped out.
>>> temp = arr.pop()
>>> print temp 
11

6.) index(x) 
Returns the first index of a value in the list. Throws error if it's not found.
>>> temp = arr.index(3)
>>> print temp
2

7.) count(x) 
Counts the number of occurrences of an element x.
>>> temp = arr.count(1)
>>> print temp
1

8.) sort() 
Sorts the list.
>>> arr.sort()
>>> print arr
[1, 2, 3, 7, 9]

9.) reverse() 
Reverses the list.
>>> arr.reverse()
>>> print arr
[9, 7, 3, 2, 1]


Task:
You have to initialize your list L = [] and follow the N commands given in N 
lines.  Commands will be 1 of the 8 commands as given above, other than extend, 
and each command will have its value separated by space.

Follow this example:

Sample Input:
12
insert 0 5
insert 1 10
insert 0 6
print 
remove 6
append 9
append 1
sort 
print
pop
reverse
print

Sample Output:
[6, 5, 10]
[1, 5, 9, 10]
[9, 5, 1]

stuck on how to deal with getting the args into the function call.
looked on HR discussion board, found one obvious solution (directly below)
